# Proof by Contradiction  
## No Pad Collision in the Parallel Pairs Protocol

### Claim
No two parties ever use the same pad index.

---

## Proof

Assume for contradiction that two distinct parties use the same pad index `i`.

Since the pad space is divided into two disjoint zones, any collision must occur within the same zone.

Within each zone:

- One party moves strictly right (+1 direction).
- The other moves strictly left (-1 direction).
- Each message consumes a contiguous interval of pad indices.

Let:
- Party A be right-moving.
- Party B be left-moving.

For both parties to use pad `i`, their consumed intervals must overlap.

However, before sending a message, each party must satisfy the safety condition:

Right-moving party:
next_end < partner_last_index - d


Left-moving party:
next_start > partner_last_index + d


These conditions enforce that at least `d` unused pads remain between the two parties.

Thus:

- Party A's interval must end strictly before B's last-used index minus `d`.
- Party B's interval must begin strictly after A's last-used index plus `d`.

Therefore, their intervals cannot overlap.

This contradicts the assumption that both used pad `i`.

Hence, pad collision is impossible.
