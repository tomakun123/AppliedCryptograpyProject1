# Waste Bound Analysis  
## Upper Bound on Unused Pads

### Claim
Total wasted pads ≤ 2d.

---

## Proof

Consider one zone.

At termination:

- Neither party can send a message of length 1.
- Therefore, the safety condition fails.

For the right-moving party:

current_index ≥ partner_last_index - d


This implies:

Remaining gap ≤ d


Thus, at most `d` unused pads remain between the two parties in that zone.

Since the protocol has 2 independent zones:

Total wasted pads ≤ 2d


---

## Waste Percentage

Waste ≤ (2d / n)


As `n → ∞`:

Waste percentage → 0


Therefore:

- Waste is bounded by a constant.
- The protocol is asymptotically efficient.
